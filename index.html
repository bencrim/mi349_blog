        <p>Baldur's Gate 3 is a popular role-playing video game set in the Dungeons & Dragons universe. Developed by Larian Studios, it immerses players in a dark, high-fantasy world, where they create custom characters and embark on an epic adventure. The game blends strategic turn-based combat with intricate storytelling, offering a rich narrative experience. Players encounter a mind-flayer parasite and form a party of diverse companions while navigating challenging moral decisions and interactions. The narrative is deeply rooted in the Forgotten Realms, and the game's early access release garnered praise for its in-depth character creation and evolving storyline, promising an exciting continuation of the beloved Baldur's Gate series. This early access release is where I first played the game. I was able to explore the first act of the story in multiple playthroughs, experimenting with different classes and alignments. This game is so well polished and content-rich that it would be a disservice for it not to be in my personal top 5 favorite games. The sheer amount of content able to be explored literally shook the gaming industry as a whole. One of my favorite parts of the game is the diverse selection of classes and subclasses to choose from when designing your character. Each class plays differently, and each subclass specifies that playstyle further. Each class and race you choose has noticeable impacts on everything from combat to dialouge. I've listed every class and subclass below so you can get an idea of what options there are.

        <p>There is a reason this game is the first blog entry. Outer Wilds is a singleplayer, first-person, mystery/story game that puts you into the shoes of an alien astronaut setting out on a journey to explore a miniaturized yet content-rich solar system. The driving motivation of the game is not readily provided to the player, instead you must figure out your purpose through exploration and discovery. The nature of the game makes it difficult to write about, because the only form of &quot;progression&quot; in the game is personal knowledge. This means that any substantial content about the game given to entice new players would detract from their playthrough. My favorite part of the game is the satisfaction you feel from learning something new. The story is set up so that you are given general pieces of information, but you're left to wonder how they tie in to each other. You must explore and discover the hidden secrets of the solar system in order to piece together the mystery yourself. The game expertly lays out clues to lead you from one area to the next, while still allowing  you to experiment and discover on your own. One of my favorite moments from my playthrough was when I accidently created a tear in space-time by exploiting a game mechanic. This exploitation was not only allowed to happen, but it was encouraged though subtle hints around the game. My only gripe with the game is that I can't play it for the first time again.
